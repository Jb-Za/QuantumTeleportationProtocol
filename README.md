# Quantum Teleportation Protocol for a quantum internet
A Quantum Teleportation Protocol  used to transfer images using Qiskit and Python 3 

Installation: 
If you experience any other issues, please refer to the official documentation as given here: https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html

I suggest intially creating a seperate virtual environment for qiskit, however it is not required. refer to these docs for venv setup: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
and 
c:\>python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv

Once you are in that environment, you will need to install the dependancies 

$ pip install qiskit

$ pip install qiskit[visualization]

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
